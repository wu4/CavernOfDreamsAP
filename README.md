# Cavern of Dreams AP Client
This client makes a large amount of changes to the base game. Here is a non-exhaustive list:

* A lot of basic movement has been split into collectible items:
    * High Jump
    * Sprinting (gaining speed by holding the roll button)
    * Rolling
    * Carrying items
    * Tail is split into Grounded Tail and Aerial Tail
    * Climbing vines and ladders
    * Swimming
    * ...and some others
* Flight has been replaced with a Double Jump
* Pause menu allows you to toggle collected abilities
* Cannot pick up Jester Boots while carrying an item, or vice-versa (to lower logic complexity)
* Checkpoints are removed
* Keehees are automatically reignited upon room re-entry
* Almost all cutscenes are now actionable for convenience
* Many dialog trees have been cut down for convenience
* Return to Start button in pause menu
* Sun Cavern no longer has a Jester Boots removal trigger. Instead, Jester Boots are lost upon entering a portal
* Gallery of Nightmare's Water Lobby (the sewers) spawns in some safety bars if you do not yet have access to Swim
